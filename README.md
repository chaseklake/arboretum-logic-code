# arboretum-logic-code
Logic code for the card game Arboretum. I'm eventually planning to turn this into a mobile app so I can play and practice and get good enough to beat my girlfriend at this game.

Disclaimer: Arboretum is owned by Dan Cassar and associates. This is a completely free code project publicly available with no money made off of it. 
It's a pet project because I enjoy the game Arboretum and I figured it would be fun to program.
